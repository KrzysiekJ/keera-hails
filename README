Keera Hails is a toolkit to create reactive applications quickly.

The toolkit is divided in three parts:
* Reactive Values: they are typed mutable values with event dispatching and
access properties. They can be modified by lifting functions and applying
lenses to them. They can also be connected so that they stay in sync during
program execution.

* Reactive bindings: Widget properties/attributes can be seen as
reactive values. So can network sockets, files and application models ('model'
as in MVC). The idea is that, at the highest application level (controller),
each layer is wrapped in a reactive container and connected to others.

* Hails: a series of tools and libraries to create MVC programs using
  a reactive interface. The application architecture takes the approach of
  "convention over configuration", which means that certain modules will be
  expected to have predetermined names. If this is much of a problem, open a
  bug report.
