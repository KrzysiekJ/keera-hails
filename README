Keera Hails is a toolkit to create reactive applications quickly.

The toolkit is divided in two parts:
* Reactive Values: they are read/write mutable values with listening/change
event dispatching. There is a rule-based interface to describe dependencies and
connections declaratively. Gtk widget properties can be seen as reactive
values. Files can be seen as reactive values. And so can application models.
The idea is that, at the highest application level (controller), each layer is
wrapped in a reactive container and connected to others.

* Hails: a series of tools and libraries to create MVC Gtk+ programs using a
  reactive interface. The application architecture takes the approach of
  "convention over configuration", which means that certain modules will be
  expected to have predetermined names. If this is much of a problem, open a bug
  report.
