This library contains functions to define RVs connected to Yampa signal
functions. The main function is yampaReactiveDual, which returns two RVs (a
readable end, or source, and a writable end, or sink).  You can write values to
the writable end, and changes will be processed by the SF and made available in
the readable end.

Yampa is a Functional Reactive Programming DSL.
