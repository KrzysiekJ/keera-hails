====================================

Lenses allow you to focus on a specific part of a reactive value. When
you have a lens, you can use it to turn a reactive value into another that
represents only a subpart of your original structure.

Open a ticket or send me a message if you use this and have a problem.

Also, I'd be happy to know (and publish a list of) programs that use
hails-reactivevalues. Please, let me know if you write something that uses it.
