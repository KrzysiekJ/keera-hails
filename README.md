This is a sample reactive program that shows the data received from
a Nintendo Wiimote's accelerometer using a Gtk GUI.

The program is very simple, there are two kinds of Reactive Values:
* Wiimote Accelerometer RVs, polled regularly.
* GUI RVs, representing the texts in the entries.

Rules are used to keep all in sync. See Minimal for more details.
